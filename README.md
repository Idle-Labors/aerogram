# Aerogram
A full stack chat application using web sockets. Postgres is used for storing user information and Redis is used to
quickly cache and retrieve messages between users, with user authentication handled via JWT. I wanted it to be something of a
callback to the days of IRC so users can join one of five publicly available channels or create their own private ones. Try it
[here](https://aerogram.vercel.app)!
